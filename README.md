# PingPanel
###  TUI Uptime Checker
 Do you manage large infrastructure?
 
 üò¥ Are you sick of entering device information into PRTG and other Uptime monitors? üò¥
 
 üñ•Ô∏è Do you long for the days when everything was in the terminal? üñ•Ô∏è

üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Do you want to just point your monitor to an inventory file and let it do the rest? üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
### Introducing PingPanel
##### PingPanel is a simple, ping only indicator of if your host is alive or not, it doesn't tell you the device temperature, doesn't support SNMP and definitely DOES NOT COME WITH ANY WARRANTY
##### Here's a picure of the main monitoring screen:

##### PingPanel works by you entering in your YAML formatted Ansible inventory, and then sorts the hosts into a tree structure, from it logs (according to your specifications) via ping how long the host is up for.
##### PingPanel will tell you if there is a status change of a deivce in the top left, and give you some numbers of how many are up/down.
##### PingPanel logs the uptime of devices in a current and historical log, aggregating the uptime into an hourly average to save on processing.

It is entirely written in python, and uses Textual to give you a nice looking, custom-themed UI all from the terminal, and under 30KB
You can currently modify:

```
Ping parameters: Check interval / Maximum Acceptable Latency / Ping Packet Count / Maximum Concurrent Ping Threads
Inventory: Location of you Ansible inventory
```

If you need to make an Ansible Inventory for your Tailscale Network then feel free to use my tool AnsiScale: https://github.com/xkz0/ansiscale

If not then you need to have an inventory structured similar to this:

```
# Ansible inventory generated from Tailscale status
